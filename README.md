# Paisa Bazaar Credit Score Classification - ML Project

This project focuses on predicting a customer's **Credit Score Category** — whether it is **Poor**, **Standard**, or **Good** — using various financial and behavioral features. The goal is to help financial institutions make smarter, faster, and more accurate lending decisions by using machine learning.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given customer data such as income, loan history, delayed payments, credit utilization, and more, build a model to classify their credit score category. The system should also provide insights into which features influence credit scoring the most.

## 📁 Project Contents
