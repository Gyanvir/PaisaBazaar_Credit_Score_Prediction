    "This machine learning project focuses on predicting an individual’s credit score category—specifically, whether their credit score is Poor, Standard, or Good. Credit scores are an essential indicator of a person's creditworthiness and play a crucial role in loan approvals, interest rates, and financial risk assessment. By building a model that can classify users based on their credit behavior and financial profile, this project aims to assist financial institutions in making informed, data-driven decisions when evaluating potential borrowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by analyzing a dataset containing 100,000 customer records and 28 columns, which included various features such as Age, Annual_Income, Monthly_Inhand_Salary, Occupation, Num_of_Loan, Outstanding_Debt, and behavioral indicators like Payment_of_Min_Amount and Payment_Behaviour. The target column was Credit_Score, which had three unique values representing different credit categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial phase involved extensive data exploration and cleaning. We checked for missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies. Some columns like Credit_Mix had missing entries, which we filled using the most frequent values. Multi-valued fields such as Type_of_Loan were carefully processed to extract individual loan types into binary columns (e.g., \"Auto Loan\", \"Student Loan\", etc.), enabling the model to better understand each customer’s loan history. Unnecessary identifiers such as customer IDs and names were removed, and categorical values were encoded properly. We also applied scaling to numerical features and used square root transformations to reduce skewness in heavily skewed columns like Total_EMI_per_month and Amount_invested_monthly.\n",
    "\n",
    "After preprocessing, we conducted hypothesis testing and exploratory visualizations to understand the relationships between key features and credit score. These visual insights helped us justify why certain features (like number of delayed payments or outstanding debt) were likely to impact a person’s credit score significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before model training, we applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle the class imbalance problem, since most customers in the dataset had a \"Standard\" credit score. The data was then split into training and test sets. We first built a baseline Logistic Regression model, which gave a decent performance with around 71% cross-validation accuracy. However, to capture more complex relationships, we trained an XGBoost classifier, which achieved a higher cross-validation accuracy of ~82%, and even after hyperparameter tuning, maintained strong generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To interpret the model, we analyzed feature importance from the XGBoost classifier. The most influential factors turned out to be Num_of_Loan, Payment_Behaviour, Delay_from_due_date, and Credit_Utilization_Ratio. This not only validated our understanding of creditworthiness but also provided clear business insights—for example, that users with high delays or too many loans are more likely to fall in the “Poor” credit category.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this project demonstrates how machine learning can effectively classify credit score categories using real-world financial and behavioral data. The final model is accurate, interpretable, and scalable for production use. With this tool, financial institutions can reduce risks, detect potential defaults early, and personalize credit offerings based on reliable credit scoring predictions. This results in more responsible lending practices and better financial outcomes for both banks and borrowers.\n",

    "The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the credit score category of a person—classified as Poor, Standard, or Good—using various financial, personal, and behavioral features.

It was able to better capture non-linear relationships in the data, such as how combinations of delayed payments, loan count, and credit utilization affect credit scores. This model is more suitable for real-world credit scoring tasks, where subtle patterns and interactions play a critical role in risk assessment."
